# Single Responsive Page Using Bootstrap

This is my repo for the DevCourse single Bootstrap page project.

I used Bootstrap for almost every styling, so very little needed to be added to my own stylesheet. I did use SCSS, but there wasn't really any reason to, I didn't need any mixins or variables.
